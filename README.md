# Email client

This is my implementation of project 3 from [CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), 2020 version.

The project consists of a single page application for an email client, using Django in the backend.
We only had to make the front-end code, all the backend code were done for us.

<br/>

## Requirements

We are asked to implement all code in `index.js` and the requirements are:
- Send mail through a `POST` request to `/emails.`
- Populate the mailbox with data fetched from `/emails/<mailbox>.`
- Display individual emails.
- Add buttons to archive or unarchive emails
- Add button to reply an email

You can see all the requirements on [this page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/).

## How to run

You can clone the repo and type `python manage.py runserver`, you must have Django installed to run a Django application. 
You can create a user or login with user `foo@example.com` and password `1234`.
